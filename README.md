key applications:
- Drone monitoring: Wireless aircraft attitude and flight data indicator with sound alerts for low battery, sharp roll/pitch angles etc.
- Flashlight: Works as a simple flash light with 20+ hours of battery life.
- Lo-Ra Radio Communication: Acts as a transmitter and receiver for Lo-Ra radio messages.
- Data Display: Shows altitude, temperature, speed, and GPS coordinates data using built-in sensors.
